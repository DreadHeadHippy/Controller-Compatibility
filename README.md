A Playnite plugin that provides controller compatibility detection and management, similar to Steam's controller compatibility system.

## Features

### 🎮 Controller Detection

- Real-time controller status monitoring
- Support for multiple controllers simultaneously

### 🎯 Game Compatibility Database  
- Maintains compatibility ratings for games:
  - ✅ **Full Controller Support** - Native gamepad support
  - 🎮 **Partial Controller Support** - Some limitations or workarounds needed
  - ❌ **No Controller Support** - Keyboard/mouse only
  - 🔧 **Community Configurations** - User-created controller configs available

### 💡 Smart Recommendations
